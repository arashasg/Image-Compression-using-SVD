# Image-Compression-using-SVD

In this project, I used dimension reduction techniques to move the data in an image to a lower-dimensional space and thus reduce the amount of information stored. Then, I returned the modified data to the original space and achieved an image with less volume and lower quality.
Finally, We Drew a diagram of the file size regarding the number of dimensions saved.
